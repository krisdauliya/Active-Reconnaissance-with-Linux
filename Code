First, Launch the Kali VM and go the terminal, do quick ping scan to  identify live hosts with a network ID of 10.1.1.*,  
and initiate a ping scan while spoofing the source MAC address of 10.1.1.*
	
	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –sP 10.1.1.*
	
Above command gives all available host starting form 10.1.1. in the network and skip port scan. We can do ping scan while spoofing the source
MAC address at the same time with prefix 0, below is the command to ping and spoofing the source MAC

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –v –sP –spoof-mac 0 10.1.1.*
	
To scan the IP protocol supported by the Host, we use below command 

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –sO 10.1.1.10

To scan Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), we use below command 

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –sT 192.168.1.6

To scan operating system, we use below command 

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –O 10.1.1.10
	
In avobe comand, Nmap may not find the exact match for the Operating system information. To gather more information about the same host regarding its OS, make
Nmap take approximate guesses as to what the OS may be, by using the command below with an included script.

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –O –-osscan-guess 10.1.1.10
	
To scan the specific pot of host ( 10.1.1.10) , we use below command ( our port for scan is port 80)

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –p 80 10.1.1.10
	
To scan the specific port of the hosts of multiple networks (192.168.1.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/28), we can use below formats 

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –p 80 192.168.1.0/24 10.1.1.0/28

Above command display all available hosts IP address, Port /Protocol, state, and service thru port, since we are scanning port 80 so port/Protocol will be 8/TCP
and service will be http. However, below command will provide more information about all available ports/protocol, and service of the network.

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap 192.168.1.0/24 

To view the IP packet sent and received through the specific IP address, we can use below command 

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –-packet-trace 10.1.1.10
	
Here, we tack the packet sent and received thru DVL VM (10.1.1.10)

Nmap can also be used to show local host data about which interfaces are up and what the route table looks like. Enter the command below.

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –iflist
	
To detect remote services, both services and daemons, along with their respective version numbers

	root@Kali-Attacker:~# nmap –sV 10.1.1.10
	
---------------We can use Zenmap for Network Scanning
Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI. It is a multi-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, etc.). We can access it from Kali terminal
just by typing zenmap. 
	Open the zenmap, 
	type 192.168.1.0/24 on target field, and 
	chose Ping scan option then scan. 

It will show Nmap outout, ports/Host info, Topology, Host Detail, Operating system, and services

We can scan multiple netwwork as well as Update the comand as needed.
